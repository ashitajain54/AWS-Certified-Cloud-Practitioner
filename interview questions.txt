Can you explain the difference between scalability and availability in AWS?
Scalability and availability are two important concepts in cloud computing and AWS.

Scalability refers to the ability of a system to handle increased workloads by adding resources. In AWS, this can be achieved by adding more instances, increasing the size of instances, or adding more storage. Scalability allows organizations to easily increase their computing capacity as needed to meet changing demands.

Availability refers to the ability of a system to remain operational and accessible to users, even in the event of a failure. In AWS, this is achieved through various features such as availability zones, auto-scaling, and load balancing. By spreading resources across multiple locations and automatically adding more resources as needed, AWS helps ensure that applications remain available to users, even if individual components fail.

Both scalability and availability are important considerations when designing and building applications in AWS, and they often work together to provide a highly available and scalable computing environment.
